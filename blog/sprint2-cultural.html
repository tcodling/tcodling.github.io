              <p>
                I am not totally sure what my long-term career pathway is! Right now 
                I am very much focused on improving my skills in tech and web development 
                as much as possible in order to open up as many opportunities as I can 
                in the future. That’s pretty much why I joined Dev Academy! I really 
                just want to upskill and learn without having to go through the 3-4 
                year learning process that is University.
              </p>
              <p>
                I am really excited to get some more experience working on group projects 
                with other people. My learning journey so far has been very individual 
                so I am so keen to work in a setting of giving and receiving advice 
                while we work through our problems. I also really want to see my 
                project planning skills increase as that has always been a weakness 
                of mine. I generally just jump into a project without any kind of 
                structure towards finding my solution. I think strategies and 
                skills in this area will make my productivity increase hugely 
                as well as increase the quality of my projects when finished.
              </p>

                In order to make sure I work as hard and efficiently as possible, I 
                found myself a single room in Wellington very close to campus. I 
                thought about staying with friends to maybe save money but I thought 
                having my own space where I can focus without distractions is going 
                to be incredibly helpful.
              </p>

                I am very aware that this course is going to be quite a challenge 
                for me in terms of the workload, the content and the teamwork aspect. 
                However I am so motivated and I really believe I can do it. Communication 
                between myself and the facilitators is going to be crucial. They are 
                going to be a great tool for keeping me on track with the details of 
                the course. However this is my own learning journey that I am responsible 
                for. I really want to be taught how to find answers and solve problems 
                as opposed to being taught answers and solutions.
              </p>

                I already know a few handy websites I can go for help but the Dev Academy 
                has set up some great resources for us. The slack channels, particularly 
                the code help desk, sound incredibly helpful. I think having access to 
                other people who have previously or are currently going through the bootcamp 
                is going to be super beneficial for everyone involved. My foundations 
                coordinator Joseph has been a great source of help when I have questions 
                about the course! The facilitation team has been great so far and I don’t 
                really expect much from them other to keep me in the loop about the course, 
                correct me when I am making huge mistakes without noticing and to answer 
                my really hard questions or to push me in the right direction towards 
                getting those answers.
              </p>
              <p>
                I don't have much scheduled for during my course, however I have been doing 
                a few shifts working as a cleaner at the stadium during the beginning of 
                foundations which has made my days slightly scattered sometimes. This 
                won’t be a problem at all when I am in Wellington and I really get stuck 
                into the boot camp.
