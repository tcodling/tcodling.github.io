        <h2>HTML and CSS</h2>
        <p>
          As I have mentioned previously, HTML is the content of the page and CSS is the 
          way that that content is styled. While both of these are extremely powerful 
          and combined they allow for almost infinite possibilities for the presentation 
          of your website, they do not allow for any interactivity in your website other 
          than refreshing and navigating between pages. This is where JavaScript and the DOM comes in.
        </p>
        <h2>Functions</h2>
        <p>
          Functions are essentially blocks of code that can be reused multiple times throughout 
          a program. Functions can take inputs and also produce values, although this is optional. 
          A function can run and perform operations on your program both with or without inputs 
          and outputs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Below is an example of a function that takes two numbers as an input and returns 
          the sum of the numbers. These numbers are inputted as parameters a and b and the 
          output is a + b as evaluated in the return statement.
        </p>
        <p class='preformatted'>
  function sumOfTwoNumbers(a, b) {  
    return a + b
  }          
        </p>
        <p>
          Here if you input sumOfTwoNumber(3, 7), you would get 10 as the output
        </p>
        <p>
          Below is an example of a function that prints “Hello!” to the console. As you can 
          see it still has an effect even without inputs or outputs!
        </p>
        <p class='preformatted'>
  function sayHello() {
    console.log(“Hello!”) 
  }
        </p>
        <h2>Loops</h2>
        <p>
          Often you might want to run a piece of code a certain number of times or until 
          a certain condition is met. You could just re-type the code a lot of times, 
          however this can very easily lead to errors and is much harder to edit at a 
          later time. This is when loops come in handy. In javascript we use two main 
          types of loop, the for loop and the while loop.
        </p>
        <p>
          The for loop is used when you want a piece of code to run a certain number of times. 
          The for loop is split into 3 parts. The starting value, the condition and the value 
          increments. In the below example i starts at 0 and increments by 1 until it reaches 
          5 and the condition is no longer met. Each time i increments the block of code is 
          run and it prints i to the console.
        </p>
        <h3>For loop example:</h3>
        <p class='preformatted'>
  for (let i=0; i&lt;5; i++) {  
    console.log(i)  
  } 
        </p>
        <p>
          The while loop is used when you want a piece of code to keep running until a condition 
          is met. In the below example the code will stop printing i when i reaches 5 and the 
          condition is no longer true.
        </p>
        <h3>While loop example:</h3>
        <p class='preformatted'>
  let i = 0 
  while (i &lt; 5) {  
    console.log(i)  
    i++ 
  } 
        </p>
        <p>
          Loops are something that are seen in our daily life. I use a for loop type process when 
          I am working out. I like doing a circuit training workout using a kettlebell where 
          I do a set of exercises 3 times. This can be represented using a for loop as follows.
        </p>
        <p class='preformatted'>
  for (let circuitCount = 1; circuitCount &lt;= 3; circuitCount++) {  
    console.log(“8 Halos”)
    console.log(“10 Goblet Squats”)
    console.log(“8 Overhead Press”)
    console.log(“15 Swings”)
    console.log(“8 Bent Rows”)
    console.log(“6 Reverse Lunges”)
  } 
        </p>
        <p>
          As you can see the whole workout is repeated three times thanks to the for loop. 
          The circuit count increases by one at the end of each loop until the circuit runs 
          three times which is the end of the workout!
        </p>
        <h2>Arrays and Objects</h2>
        <p>
          Arrays are lists of data presented in this format wrapped in square braces: 
        </p>
        <p class='preformatted'> let shoppingList = [“Cheese”, “Milk”, “Bread”] </p>
        <p>
          If you wanted to access “Milk” in this array, you would use the statement: 
          <span class='preformatted'> shoppingList[1] </span>. JavaScript arrays count 
          from 0. This means that the first item in the array has an index of 0, the 
          second has an index of 1 and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
          Objects are similar to arrays in that they store a list of data, however they 
          contain key: value pairs rather than index numbers and are wrapped in curly 
          braces. They are presented in this format:
        </p>
        <p class='preformatted'>
  let person = {
    name: “John Doe”,
    age: 22,
    occupation: “Teacher”,
    sayGreeting() {
      console.log(“Morning class!”) 
    }
  }          
        </p>
        <p>
          You may have noticed that we have something that looks like a function in our object. 
          This is called a method and when it is called it acts just the same as a function when 
          called. What makes objects so incredible and versatile is that you can add so many 
          different types of data to an object.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you wanted to access the object name value you would use: 
          <span class='preformatted'> person.name </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          If you wanted to call the sayGreeting method you could simply call: 
          <span class='preformatted'> person.sayGreeting() </span>
        </p>
        <h2>Control Flow</h2>
        <p>
          Control flow is the order that the computer processes your program in JavaScript. In general,
          JavaScript reads programs from the first line to the last line but there are many statements it
          could run across that affects this order. For instance, loops affect the control flow.
          When the code block in a loop reaches the bottom, instead of reading the next line after, the loop
          will make the computer go back to the start of the block and will keep repeating that block of code until the loop condition
          is no longer valid. Functions also affect the control flow of the document. Interestingly enough, functions 
          can be declared at any point in the program as JavaScript goes through the document and binds functions
          first. When these functions are referenced in other parts of the code, the reader then jumps to that 
          functions block of code and processes it accordingly!
        </p>
        <h2>The DOM</h2>
        <p>
          The DOM is essentially a representation of the HTML and CSS styles in the form of a 
          JavaScript object. It is because the DOM is structured like this that you can 
          interact with it. The DOM contains all of the HTML elements with their accompanying 
          styles, however it also contains a large amount of methods that allow you to 
          interact with it and alter the content inside. This opens up all sorts of new 
          possibilities for interactivity that doesn’t require constant reloading of the 
          page or navigation around the website.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can access the DOM using dot notation like you would any other JavaScript object. If you wanted
          to store an html element in a variable you can use one of the built in methods like this:
          <span class='preformatted'> let exampleElement = document.getElementById('exampleId') </span> 
          You can then use dot notation to manipulate its attributes like this: 
          <span class='preformatted'> exampleElement.backgroundColor = 'blue' </span>, 
          <span class='preformatted'> exampleElement.height = '400px' </span> and so on
        </p>
