              <h2>What is emotional intelligence? (EQ)</h2>
              <p>Emotional intelligence is all about being in tune with the emotions of yourself and the people around you. A big part is realising the separation between the reality that you see and feel and the emotions swirling around in everyoneâ€™s heads. Someone with high EQ realises when they are being unreasonable or letting their emotions get the better of them and they can then act accordingly. Someone with high EQ can also recognise this in other people, they realise that the way people present themselves is not always representative of what they are feeling or what their intentions are. Analysing these emotions and being conscious of this in yourself and others is what allows you to be more empathetic and achieve more in your own work as well as when you are part of a team.</p>
              <h2>What is the difference between IQ and EQ?</h2>
              <p>IQ is your ability to process and make decisions based on information. EQ is your ability to process and make decisions based on emotion. These two things are very very different and do not really cross over. </p>
              <p>Another key difference is that IQ is often hard to train and change, however EQ is constantly changing and forming over the course of your lifetime. Your EQ is affected heavily by the emotional capabilities of the people around you as you grow up. People who did not have good emotional role models growing up can have the intellect to become brilliant mathematicians, scientists, programmers or anything that might require high IQ and problem solving abilities. This does not however mean that they will automatically get further in life than someone who grew up in a nurturing empathetic family that gave them the skills to empathize with others and control their own emotions, both extremely important qualities for working in a team. EQ can be practiced and trained, it requires constant deep analysis of your own emotions and actions as well as those of the people around you.</p>
              <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
              <p>Just because someone is skilled at a task or knowledgeable about a topic, doesn't mean they are a good person or fun to work with. In my previous job I worked with some people who were incredible at their jobs in terms of performance, but they absolutely could not work in a team. This leads to all sorts of problems with not only productivity but also the overall culture and environment of the team.</p>
              <p>Here is a great <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgUCyWhJf6s' class='externalLink'>video</a> detailing EQ and the consequences of not having enough education on the topic in our society.</p>
