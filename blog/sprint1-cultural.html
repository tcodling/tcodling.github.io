               <h2>What are my values?</h2>
               <p>Here is a really cool <a href='https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTED_85.htm' class='externalLink'>article</a> that helped me identify my values. I had not thought of a lot of these so it was super helpful to have them laid out like this.</p>
               <p>Using the above article’s strategy for figuring out the order from most to least important, I grabbed my 10 top values from their list:</p>
               <ol>
                   <li>Empathy</li>
                   <li>Happiness</li>
                   <li>Goodness</li>
                   <li>Inner Harmony</li>
                   <li>Positivity</li>
                   <li>Love</li>
                   <li>Freedom</li>
                   <li>Openness</li>
                   <li>Continuous Improvement</li>
                   <li>Calmness</li>
               </ol>
               <p>These values have all been formed from the upbringing and the environment I was in growing up. I am extremely lucky enough to come from a really loving and supportive family who constantly believe in me and help me to succeed. This is regardless of whether I am doing great in life or if I have made mistakes. I only realised how special and helpful this kind of support has been as I got older and saw more of the world and other relationships and family dynamics. This support has given me loads of confidence and belief in myself as well as the ability to pick myself up when I am down</p>
               <p>I grew up on a relatively small island of around 8000 people. In my school there were around 400 people from years 7-13. I feel as though growing up in this small close-knit community had a huge influence on my values growing up. The island is not very commercial and has generally always had a huge focus on the finer things in life such as art and beauty. I believe having this simple upbringing really helped form the values and activities that are important to me such as staying stress-free, living in the moment and not getting too caught up chasing money.</p>
               <p>Living on the super isolated Waiheke Island I managed to have pretty much the same group of friends for the first 18 years of my life. These lifelong friendships are super important to me and are super special bonds that are still important to me to this day. I believe it's super important to have people to care for as well as having people care for you. I think it gives everyone a feeling they have value.</p>
               <h2>Things other people have said about me</h2>
               <p>I asked some of my family and friends to give me a couple quotes about what I am like as a person and here is what I got:</p>
               <ul>
                   <li>Empathetic and very kind</li>
                   <li>Strong values and morals</li>
                   <li>Is grateful, doesn't take people for granted</li>
                   <li>Introverted and likes alone time doing projects</li>
                   <li>Is a loyal friend, has a diverse range of friends</li>
               </ul>
               <h2>Achievements</h2>
               <p>I have achieved a few things in my life that I am super proud of. The biggest for me personally was moving out of my house on Waiheke Island and managing to create a life for myself independently.</p>
               <p>One of the first big achievements of my life was getting first in Calculus and Physics as well as second in year in year 13. This was the first time I really remember setting my mind on a quite difficult academic goal, working really hard at it and then achieving it. I was always one of those people who found school came naturally to me so I really just coasted through getting pretty good marks without putting in too much effort. I feel this was the first time I really challenged myself and in turn saw the positive results of effort and struggle.</p>
               <h2>Quotes that resonate with me</h2>
               <ul>
                   <li>“Never be in a hurry; do everything quietly and in a calm spirit. Do not lose your inner peace for anything whatsoever, even if your whole world seems upset.” —Saint Francis de Sales</li>
                   <li>“It isn't what you have, or who you are, or where you are, or what you are doing that makes you happy or unhappy. It is what you think about.” —Dale Carnegie</li>
                   <li>"When things change inside you, things change around you." —Unknown</li>
               </ul>
               <h2>My personality type and strengths</h2>
               <p>Here is a <a href='https://www.16personalities.com/profiles/98bb438a0b573' class='externalLink'>link</a> to my personality profile on 16personalities.com</p>
               <p>I have done this test a few times and I always get the Mediator. I always find the descriptions scarily accurate to me. “Mediator personalities are true idealists, always looking for the hint of good in even the worst of people and events, searching for ways to make things better.” This intro sentence describes me pretty perfectly. My interpersonal strengths have always laid in making people feel better about themselves and their situation and resolving conflict.</p>
               <p>Interestingly enough even though the mediator personality has stayed the same as Ive got older, I have gained the assertive trait. I have definitely become more assertive and confident in myself and my abilities the further I get into life and the more I achieve.</p>
               <p>As I've grown up, I have realised that I definitely have a bit of an obsessive personality. I often find that when I find a source of pleasure or satisfaction, I just want to keep doing that one thing until I eventually can’t stand it anymore. This trait is both an advantage and a disadvantage as it can lead to me wasting time on things that aren't productive but when I can obsess over something productive, I can really get a lot done. I have really only recently noticed this pattern in myself and I am trying to learn how to harness it in a positive way and use it to achieve my goals. This is one of my largest reasons for getting into Web Development as Design and Programming are the two things I have studied previously that I have managed to lose hours and days grinding away at my projects with no issue because I was enjoying myself!</p>
               <h2>My limitations</h2>
               <p>I have noticed in the past that my learning is heavily affected by how interested or motivated I am on the subject. I often really struggle to put effort and time into things that I can not see and benefit it doing/learning. Luckily, design and programming are the two things that I have really enjoyed in the past and I have not had any trouble motivating myself to study Web Development (I have been doing it for the last couple months before the start of course).</p>
               <p>I am also not overly experienced in group work and have had mixed results in the past. In my first year at university I worked on a product design project with two others on designing a tree trimmer. One of the biggest problems with productivity was that one of the members would often not do his work and would always come up with a reason why he didn't bring it on that day (did on a computer at home, accidentally deleted etc). This really affected our project as neither of us other two group members were assertive enough to call him out and hold him accountable and we just ended up doing all of the work. This was definitely not the best way to do things as I made it harder on myself as I had more work to do, but I also reinforced his negative behaviour as he successfully got away with it. I feel I am now much more assertive and self confident. I would hope that If I ever found myself in a similar situation that I would hold the group member accountable for their actions and not just let myself get walked over as I have in the past as I honestly believe that negatively affects all parties involved.</p>
