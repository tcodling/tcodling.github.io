              <h2 class='border-background'>Things I learned about myself</h2>
              <p>
                I learned quite a bit about myself during these core exercises, particularly during the identity, 
                values and strengths exploration. During this exercise I got a pretty clear idea of what my values 
                in life are and how they came to be which is something I had never really thought about before. I gained 
                a real appreciation for my upbringing and the environment that I grew up in. This content also gave me 
                the opportunity to really put myself out there which is something I never really do and was surprised at the 
                amount of stuff I was able to write and the detail I went into.
              </p>
              <h2 class='border-background'>The importance of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming</h2>
              <p>
                Being in tune with your emotions and the emotions of others is an extremely important skill in programming 
                and life in general. Understanding why people feel and act in certain ways is so valuable as it makes you fun 
                to be around and easy to work with. Someone with no self-awareness or awareness of others feelings will not be 
                good to work with at all as they wont be able to work in a team effectively.
              </p>
              <p>
                Teamwork is one of the key aspects of working on programming projects so it is so important to work on 
                your self awareness and empathy skills in order to make sure that you are an effective team member and 
                fun to work with. These skills will do wonders in terms of finding employment and completing projects efficiently.
              </p>
              <h2 class='border-background'>What surprised me?</h2>
              <p>
                How much I actually learned about myself. The exercise where we needed to explore our values 
                and how they came to be was far more effective and interesting than I expected. I was also 
                pretty surprised to have learned about EQ. I knew that being emotionally intelligent was important 
                in life but I was surprised that it had a name and some actual science behind it.
              </p>
              <h2 class='border-background'>What challenged me?</h2>
              <p>
                Writing about myself on a public blog like this is extremely unlike me. I initially found it pretty 
                weird posting all these personal blogs about myself but after a reading others blogs and doing it a 
                couple more times I felt much more comfortable with sharing a bit about myself.
              </p>
              <p>
                English has always been my worst subject so even just the amount of writing in these blog posts 
                was pretty hard for me. I do find myself really enjoying the content though so I am finding it much 
                easier to write than usual.
              </p>
              <h2 class='border-background'>Why does Dev Academy focus on this?</h2>
              <p>
                Dev Academy focuses on personal skills which is something I have never been taught in any of my
                previous education experiences. 
                I think Dev Academy realises the importance of actually being a good person/worker in order to get 
                employed. Skills do not always translate directly into jobs when the person with the skills is no 
                good to work with. 
              </p>
              <p>
                I think its a great idea to make people think about themselves, but it is also 
                great to make people come out of their shells to each other a little bit before we spend 9 weeks working together 
                during the boot-camp where we are going to be spending a huge amount of time together
              </p>
              <h2 class='border-background'>Was this a waste of time that I should have spent programming?</h2>
              <p>
                Not in the slightest. I really believe that emotional and interpersonal skills are just as important as professional 
                skills in the workplace and in life. I also found this content super interesting and rewarding to work through. 
                I learned a lot about myself and some cool concepts relating to the mind and emotions that I will definitely 
                take into consideration throughout this course! 
              </p>
              <h1>Things to consider during Bootcamp</h1>
              <h2 class='border-background'>What are my long term goals?</h2>
              <p>
                I am still not totally sure what my long term career goals are. All that I really know right now is that 
                I want to expand my skills in this field and open as many new opportunities as possible. I am absolutely 
                loving my study so far in web development so I am almost certain I want to pursue some kind of career in the 
                field.
              </p>
              <h2 class='border-background'>What are my strengths and limitations going to be</h2>
              <p>
                I am definitely at an advantage in that I have previously studied Web Development on my own. It has 
                been a huge help throughout the foundations and I think it will help me technically as I go further into the 
                bootcamp. While I have definitely gotten better at planning my code before I start writing it during foundations, I think I 
                still have heaps of development to come in this area as I am still not the best at planning and then executing, 
                I still do quite a bit of executing and then cleaning up which is not ideal (especially if I am working in a 
                team setting).
              </p>
              <h2 class='border-background'>What non-technical challenges am I going to encounter?</h2>
              <p>
                The Dev Academy bootcamp sounds very intense in terms of workload and the stuff they get us to do. With this 
                is going to come all sorts of challenges as I go a little out of my comfort zone. While I am nowhere near 
                as bad I used to be, I think my public speaking skills will probably be pretty terrible. I think I will 
                almost certainly struggle a little with the workload too. 70 hours a week is unlike anything I have ever done 
                before so I really don't know totally how well I will handle it and be able to keep on top of it. I am super 
                motivated however and will definitely do my absolute best to keep to my schedule and get through the work.
              </p>
              <h2 class='border-background'>What non-technical skills do I want to develop?</h2>
              <p>
                I would really like to gain some good experience working as part of a team. I am glad the Dev Academy 
                has a huge focus on pair programming and team based work as that is a key aspect of programming that 
                I have almost no experience in. I think these skills are essential in 
                order to be as productive and employable as possible. I think it also going to be great to get some presentation experience, 
                I think it will be hugely helpful to be more confident in conveying my ideas to people when public 
                speaking.
              </p>
              <h2 class='border-background'>What do I expect from myself?</h2>
              <p>
                This will likely be the most disciplined I will have to be with myself in a while. I expect myself to 
                keep on top of my schedule and to persevere and try my hardest during the entire 9 weeks. I will make sure I am 
                fully aware of and make use of all of the resources supplied online and by Dev Academy.
