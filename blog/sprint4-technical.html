              <h2 class='border-background'>Getting stuck on simple problems</h2>
                <p>
                  There are so many things going on when you are programming it is inevitable that 
                  you will get stumped on some pretty simple and easily resolved problems. Thats why it
                  is important when you are stuck to make sure you regularly take a step back and try some problem solving
                  techniques to figure out what went wrong.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A great example of this was when I was first working on this blog. I made the super simple 
                  mistake of working on my local version of the website while trying to check my changes 
                  on the live version. This obviously didn't work and I am embarrassed to admit the amount of 
                  time I lost trying to figure out why the changes I was making to my code weren't displaying. 
                  When I finally googled why my browser wasn't updating, the first stack overflow answer basically 
                  told me that it was probably my fault and I was modifying the wrong file. While not exactly what was 
                  happening, it encouraged me to actually look at how I setup my workspace and quickly realised 
                  my mistake. After this experience I have definitely been much more careful in my setup and I also 
                  now seek the opinions of others much sooner in order to get a fresh take on the situation
                </p>
              <h2 class='border-background'>Solving a problem in an elegant way</h2>
                <p>
                  One of the most satisfying parts of this sprint for me was in the JS-olympics kata. 
                  For the unjumble function, I jumped into coding it without planning and ended up with a terrible 
                  initial approach.  
                  I was trying to loop through an array of the letters and ended up with a huge mash
                  of ugly code that didn't even work. For some reason I was thinking I had to use a loop.
                  I thought the best thing to do was take a step back and actually write down the steps 
                  that I was trying to achieve in some psuedocode. When doing this, I realised that
                  most of what I was trying to achieve were actually all built in methods. I then googled
                  the methods and found the 3 that I needed and passed the test on my first try with this 
                  beautiful single line function:
                </p>
                <p class='preformatted'>
  const unjumble = (string) => {
    return string.split('').reverse().join('')  
  }
                </p>
              <h3 class='border-background'>Here are some great problem solving techniques I have been using over the past few weeks</h3>
              <div>
                <h3>Googling</h3>
                <p>
                  The internet is an incredible resource for programmers. If you know exactly how to phrase your 
                  problem in a way that google likes, you can find the solution to pretty much every problem you 
                  come across (or something extremely similar). There are incredible forums online where people
                  share their questions and snippets of code. Often solving your problem is as simple as 
                  asking google a question and then copying the first snippet of code you see.
                </p>
                <h3>Console.logging</h3>
                <p>
                  <span class='preformatted'> Console.log </span> is my best friend when I am coding javascript. Console.log gives 
                  you a window into your code and allows you to keep track of your variables and 
                  functions as your code runs. When I come across an error due to a variable being 
                  incorrect or a function generating a wrong output, console.log is my first port of call.
                </p>
                <h3>Reading Error Messages</h3>
                <p>
                  Javascript seems to be particularly ruthless with the error messages it gives you. 
                  Sometimes they can be super helpful and sometimes they can be downright useless. 
                  You can extract some helpful information from these however that will at least 
                  bring you closer to finding out the problem.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Error messages seem scary when you first see them, but they can easily be broken 
                  down. Here is the basic structure of an error message:
                </p>
                <!--STRANGE FORMATTING TO PRESERVE WHITESPACE-->
                <p class='preformatted'>
  Error: please improve your code
    at locationOfError:line:column
    at nextLocationOfError:line:column  
    ...
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  The amount that this statement will help varies greatly from error to error, but you 
                  can usually get some pretty helpful information regarding the locations of the error 
                  and the type that you should be looking out for
                </p>
                <h3>Psuedocode</h3>
                <p>
                  When you try to write a function that performs a task. It can be easier to keep on 
                  track of what you are doing if you write out the steps of the function in simple 
                  english first before diving into writing out code. Writing out the steps gives you 
                  time to think about what the code should actually do before you start. It also makes 
                  it easier to work through when you have all of the steps and functionality laid out 
                  just above where you are writing your code.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Psuedocode is something I have been trying to integrate more into my programming habits 
                  I have a tendency to dive into writing code however I have found actually writing out the 
                  steps in plain english has helped me so much in forming an approach for my block of code.
                </p>
                <h3>Asking your peers for help</h3>
                <p>
                  In my experience, one of the best debuggers is a fresh set of eyes. I am lucky enough to 
                  have a flatmate who has some experience in these languages so I can show my code to him 
                  if I want input from someone with a different perspective. Everyone has a different approach to
                  every problem and different levels of knowledge in different areas.
                  Having someone else look at your problem from their perspective allows them to add suggestions or
                  point out errors that you would have never even considered while writing your code.
