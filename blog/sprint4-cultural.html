              <p>
                Neuroplasticity is the ability that our brain has to physically react 
                to the actions and experiences that we have throughout our life. When we perform 
                a skill or action, a neural pathway forms or strengthens. Its through this process 
                that we get better at things with repetition and deliberate learning.
              </p>
              <p>
                Understanding this concept can have a huge impact on your learning. Knowing how
                skills and knowledge are actually imprinted into your brain through repitition 
                allows you to take advantage of this and learn much more effectively
              </p>
              <p>
                Neuroplasticity can be increased in a number of ways. Every experience and 
                interaction that you have throughout your day has a physical effect on your brain.
                Whether it is significant, minor, good or bad, everything has an effect!

                Below is a great infographic I found going over the topic:

              <h2 class='border-background'>Growth vs Fixed mindset</h2>
              <p>
                The Growth mindset is all about understanding that our brains are malleble objects
                that can change and grow throughout our lives. You wont be good at something the first 
                time you try, skills are learned by understanding that through repitition and deliberate learning, 
                you can get better at something. The opposite of the growth mindset
                is the Fixed mindset which is the belief that skills and knowledge are fixed and
                cannot be worked on and improved. The fixed mindset can be incredibly limiting
                as it can cause you to not even try at something just because you aren't good at
                it initially. This is obviously not ideal as almost no one is good at something 
                the first time they do it!
              </p>
              <p>
                I have always been huge on the Growth
                mindset and am constantly putting in effort to ensure I am not putting up walls between
                myself and new experiences. Taking this growth mindset into my course at Dev Academy 
                is going to be so important in order to ensure I get the most out of the course. The 
                courseload is heavy and will likely feel overwhelming at some points but it is important
                that I stick to it and understand that what I am doing is meant to be hard and I wont
                learn it overnight
