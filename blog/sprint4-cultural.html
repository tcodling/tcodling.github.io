              <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
              <p>
                Neuroplasticity is the ability that our brain has to physically react 
                to the actions and experiences that we have throughout our life. When we perform 
                a skill or action, a neural pathway forms or strengthens. Its through this process 
                that we get better at things with repetition and deliberate learning.
              </p>
              <p>
                Understanding this concept can have a huge impact on your learning. Knowing how
                skills and knowledge are actually imprinted into your brain through repitition 
                allows you to take advantage of this and learn much more effectively
              </p>

              <h2>Growth vs Fixed mindset</h2>
              <p>
                The Growth mindset is all about understanding that our brains are malleble objects
                that can change and grow throughout our lives. The opposite of the growth mindset
                is the Fixed mindset which is the belief that skills and knowledge are fixed and
                cannot be worked on and improved
              </p>
              <p>
                I have always been huge on the Growth
                mindset and am constantly putting in effort to ensure I am not putting up walls between
                myself and new experiences. Taking this growth mindset into my course at Dev Academy 4
                is going to be so important in order to ensure I get the most out of the course.
